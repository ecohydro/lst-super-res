# lst-super-res
This repository constitutes a U-Net model whose goal is to increase the resolution of a low resolution image (1 band) with the help with a seperate high resolution input (3 bands). Concretely, this model was developed to increase the resolution of Land Surface Temperate (LST) images from 70m to 10m with the help of a 10m RGB basemap. The code for our U-Net was adapted from https://github.com/milesial/Pytorch-UNet. 

This code is highly flexible and, as with the U-Net implementation we borrow our basic structure from, takes any resonably sized image (try ~300-2000 pixels on each side). There are two inputs into the model: a *basemap* (in our case RGB), which should be at the resolution of the desired output, and a *coarse target* (in our case LST) which should be at the desired resolution of your original image you are hoping to increase the resolution of, but resized to the same resolution as the basemap. The output which the model will be trained on should be the same size and resolution as the basemap input. 

Because high resolution training data of the target of choice is not always very available, the model also includes a pre-training feature wherein the model can create artificial data from basemap data and the model learns to highten the resolution of this artificial data, at which these weights can be transfered to the task using real target data. We include code to download and process RGB basemaps from PlanetLabs with some information on different land covers, though one must provide their own API key. 

Finally, a pixel-level Random Forest regressor is also available as a benchmark for performance on our various evaluation metrics.

## Installation instructions

1. Install [Conda](http://conda.io/)

2. Create environment and install requirements

```bash
conda create -n lst-super-res python=3.9 -y
conda activate lst-super-res
conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio cudatoolkit=10.2 -c pytorch -y
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

_Note:_ depending on your setup you might have to install a different version of PyTorch (e.g., compiled against CUDA). See https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/

3. Add data

The processed dataset for this particular project is currently not publicly available. However, one should manually add inputs and outputs and specify their paths in a configs/*.yaml file. Speficially, you will need to add paths to three folders:

- `input_basemap`: This folder is constituted of 8-bit, 3-band images of your basemap of choice (in our case RGB), all the same size and resolution (e.g. 672x672 pixels at 10m resolution)
- `input_target`: This folder is constituted of single band floating point images of your target (in our case LST) at a coarse resolution (e.g. 70m) but resampled to the same size and resolution as the basemap and the desired output. 
- `output_target`: This folder is constituted of your labels: single band floating point images of your target (in our case LST) at the desired improved resolution (e.g. 10m in our case.) 

_Note:_ Corresponding images from matching scenes should be named the same between folders, or you will get an error. 

The location of some metadata must also be included in your configs file:
- `splits_loc`: This the location of your file that determines how your dataset is to be split. This is created in step 4: 'Split data', and is a csv with the name of an image and whether it belongs to the "train", "val" or "test" set. The most recent file in this folder are used as your split.
- `target_norm_loc`: This is a space delimited file that includes mean and sd columns with entries for all of your target input images (in our case, LST). The average across these are taken to normalize the inputs. [This is being updated and likely be obsolete since mean and sd of. thetarget norm will be calcualted in the dataloader]. 
- `basemap_norm_loc`: This is a space delimited file that includes mean (mean1, mean2, mean3) and sd (sd1, sd2, sd3) columns with entries for all of your input basemap images (in our case, RGB). The average across these are taken to normalize the inputs. This file is to be used both during pre-training and regular training of the model. 

- The metadata on the runs which includes information on their land cover type, `runs_metadata.csv` should be stored in a folder named "metadata" which is within your `data_root` as specified in your configs file. 

_Note:_ It is OK to have NA values in the input and output target, but not in your basemaps. There is built-in functionality to ignore areas where there is no information for the target: input NAs are set to 0 and output NAs are ignored when calculating the loss.

If you are interested in pre-training your model, you will need to provide the following paths and other configurations must be specified in the configs/*.yaml file (or instead, if you are only doing pretraining):

- `pretrain`: This is a boolean value that when set to `TRUE`, tells the model to perform pre-training.

- `pretrain_input_basemap`: This folder is constituted of 8-bit, 3-band images of your basemap of choice (in our case RGB), all the same size and resolution (e.g. 672x672 pixels at 10m resolution)

- `pretrain_splits_loc`: This the location of your file that determines how your dataset is to be split. It should contain a csv with the name of an image and whether it belongs to the "train", "val" or "test" set. The most recent file in this folder are used as your split.

- `pretrain_basemap_norm_loc`: This is a space delimited file that includes mean (mean1, mean2, mean3) and sd (sd1, sd2, sd3) columns with entries for all of your pre-training input basemap images (in our case, RGB). The average across these are taken to normalize the inputs.

The metadata on these high resolution RGB images which includes information on their land cover type, `pretrain_metadata.csv` should be stored in a folder named "metadata" which is within your `data_root` as specified in your configs file.

4. Split data

To create a data split, you will need to have your data available in the location specified in your configs file and your metadata file, `data_root/runs_metadata.csv`, which will be used to ensure your splits are even across different variables. 

_Note:_ If `pretrain` is set to `True` in your configuration file, the metadata information should be stored as a CSV file under `data_root/pretrain_metadata.csv`. The output folder will be `data_root/metadata/pretrain_splits`.

```bash
python3 code/split.py --config configs/base.yaml
```

This will create `data_root/metadata/splits`, a folder containing a CSV file that indicates which observation belongs to each split and a .txt file that provides additional information regarding the split. Note that `data_root` is declared in your specified configuration file.

Make sure to check if you consider your split to be adequately distributed across the variables of interest specified in your metadata file. 

## Reproduce results

1. Train

In the configs folder, create a *.yaml file for your experiment. See base.yaml as a example. 


```bash
python code/train.py --config configs/base.yaml
```

This will create a trained model which is saved at each epoch in the checkpoints folder, `experiment_dir`. This folder contains model checkpoints, a copy of the configuration file used, and a copy of split info used during training. The path to this directory is declared in your configuration file.

During training, weights and biases (wandb) is used to automatically generate visualizations of the training data and plot out the loss (MSE) of the training and validation sets. Wandb logs are generated and saved in the folder `code/wandb`. 

2. Predictions and validation

Generate predictions. These will be saved in the predictions folder of your experiment. If predictions are desired for another split, you can also specify 'test' or 'train'. 

```bash
python code/predict.py --config configs/base.yaml --split train
python code/predict.py --config configs/base.yaml --split val
```
This will create `experiment_dir/predictions`, a folder containing all predicted target images separated by split. 

Then, visualize and calcualte metrics for your predictions. 

```bash
python code/predict_vis.py --config configs/base.yaml --split train
python code/predict_vis.py --config configs/base.yaml --split val
```

This will create the following folders and files: 
`experiment_dir/prediction_metrics`: A folder containing a CSV file that includes evaluation metrics (R2, SSIM, MSE) for each prediction separated by split

`experiment_dir/prediction_plots`: A folder containing PNG files that includes the basemap image, coarsened target image, predicted target image, and ground truth image for each prediction separated by split. Also shows image name, landcover type, prediction metrics and coarsened input metrics.

3. Test/inference

Once you are ready to test your model on your held out test set, run the following: 

```bash
python code/predict.py --config configs/base.yaml --split test
python code/predict_vis.py --config configs/base.yaml --split test
```

## Random Forest Regressor Model

The random forest regressor model, which represents the state-of-the-art approach prior to the U-Net model we implement for enhancing the resolution of land surface temperature images, employs a statistical pixel-based technique. In order to evaluate its performance against our custom U-Net model, we employ the random forest regressor.

```bash
python code/RF.py --config configs/base.yaml --split train
python code/RF.py --config configs/base.yaml --split val
python code/RF.py --config configs/base.yaml --split test
```

This will produce `/RF/results.csv`, a CSV file that includes the file name, landcover type, as well as the R2 and RMSE values.
